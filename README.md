See [analysis](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alexarchambault/auto-type-class-benchmark/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb) (jump to [results](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alexarchambault/auto-type-class-benchmark/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb#Results)).

I'd be really interested in runs of the benchmarks on configs other than mine. If you ran them as [indicated](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alexarchambault/auto-type-class-benchmark/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb#Running-the-benchmark) in the analysis, feel free to submit their result (CSV file) as a PR to this repository.
